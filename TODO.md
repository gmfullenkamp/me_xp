# TODOs:
1. Add a nice sound for when a task is completed.
2. Add a nice sound for when there is a level up.
3. Add a minecraft pain sound whenever the user tries to do a window of reset xp.
4. Add a death sound when the user does reset their xp.
5. Make an initial dropdown for new users where they can add specialization that they want to track (instead of tracking them all).
6. Make a separate 'Add Specialization' button so old users can pick up new specializations if they want.
7. Make a separate 'Remove Specialization' button so old users can remove old specializations that they never really cared about. (Be sure to warn them of their lost XP!)
8. Make a randomized welcoming slogan at the top in large bold letters for the user whenver they open the app (randomized).
10. Add a 'total times complete' in with the streaks stats for each goal.
