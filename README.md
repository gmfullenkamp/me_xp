# 🧠 Me XP – Level Up Your Life

"Life is the ultimate RPG. You don’t just play the hero—you become them." -Grant Fullenkamp

**Me XP** is a gamified life progression tracker that lets you earn experience and level up in real-world specializations—like *Running*, *Coding*, *Strength Training*, *Cooking*, and more. Inspired by RPGs and idle games like *Melvor Idle*, this system turns personal growth into a game worth mastering.

With Me XP, every step, rep, habit, and goal brings you closer to your next level.

## 🚀 What Is Me XP?

In *Me XP*, every action counts. Whether you jog a mile, learn a new algorithm, or cook dinner for your friends, you earn XP toward that specialization. Progress through levels, unlock new goals, and challenge yourself with tasks of increasing complexity.

Each specialization (e.g., **Running**) has:
- 🧩 **Tiered Goals** with different intensity levels
- 🎯 **XP rewards** scaled to difficulty
- 🧱 **Levels 1–100**, divided into 10 tiers
- 🔄 **Streaks, bonuses, and synergy** between skills (future)
